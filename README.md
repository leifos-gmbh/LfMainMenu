# LfMainMenu

Fully configurable ILIAS main menu. Latest version needs ILIAS 5.0.3+ (current git version) or higher.

If you use ILIAS 5.4.x the default "Personal Desktop" submenu will no be rendered anymore. You need to setup a custom menu and add the subfeatures one by one to get the same result.

Why 5.4 support? ILIAS 5.4 includes a configurable main menu now, but if you used this plugin before you may miss some of its features, e.g. submenu support.

Features
- Custom menus and submenus(!)
- Standard menus "Personal Desktop", "Repository" and "Administration"
- Separators
- All features of the Personal Desktop (Bookmarks, Calendar, Mail, ...) can be separately embedded (automatic feature activation check, no need to use complicated GUI class paths)
- All repository nodes (by using their Ref IDs) embeddable
- "Last Visited" integration
- Multilinguality
- Custom URLs and permission checks
 
Installation
- Download the zip file
- Extract content into a subdirectory Customizing/global/plugins/Services/UIComponent/UserInterfaceHook/LfMainMenu within your main ILIAS directory
- Enter ILIAS Administration > Plugins and activate/configure the plugin
